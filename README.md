# SwitftBQ
> **Status**: Beta 3.1
> **Version**: 3.1.0

SwitftBQ is a modern web application designed to streamline the process of creating Bills of Quantities (BQ) and managing quotations. Built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, it offers a responsive and intuitive interface for construction and project management professionals.

## 🚀 What's New in Beta 3.1
- **🔒 Data Isolation & Security**:
    - **User-Specific Data**: Projects and BQ Items are now strictly isolated per user account. Using custom UUID logic, we ensure zero data leakage between users.
    - **Robust Auth**: App settings and profile data are now consistently hydrated from the database on login.
- **🗑️ Cascading Delete**:
    - **Clean Database**: Deleting a project now permanently removes all associated BQ Items and Project Versions, preventing orphaned data and saving space.
- **⚡ Optimistic UI Updates**:
    - **Instant Feedback**: Creating projects now instantly updates the UI without requiring a page refresh.
    - **Version Handling**: Initial Empty Versions are properly attached on creation for immediate access.
- **🐛 Critical Bug Fixes**:
    - **UUID Compatibility**: Fixed "invalid input syntax for type uuid" by implementing standard UUID generation across the app.
    - **Empty Catalog Fix**: Resolved an issue where new projects started with an empty master list; they now correctly snapshot the current master data.
    - **Settings UI**: Fixed visual bugs where empty profile fields showed default text instead of blanks.

## 🚀 What's New in Beta 3.0
- **Cloud Synchronization**:
    - **User Profile Sync**: Name, Contact, and Role changes in Settings are now seamlessly synced to the cloud database.
    - **Company Info Sync**: Company Name, Address, and Bank details are now persisted across sessions via the database.
- **Robust Data Handling**: Fixed database column mappings (e.g., `phone`) to ensure reliable data storage.
- **Input Validation**: Added strict input validation for Contact Numbers (digits, +, -, spaces only) to maintain data quality.
- **Enhanced Add Item UI**: New modal with "Save & Add Another" workflow and smart price inputs directly in the creation flow.
- **Formulas Live Update**: Catalog changes now immediately trigger price recalculations (DDP, SP, RSP) without refresh.
- **Smart BQ Linkage**: Saving changes in the Catalog now instantly updates all linked items in the BQ Review list.
- **Reliable Calculations**:
    - Fixed "Grand Total NaN" issues by adding robust safety checks.
    - Updated Grand Total logic to strictly sum the item TRSP column for accuracy.
- **PDF Export Polish**: Fixed vertical alignment issues in generated PDF tables to ensure professional centering.
